# 01. Setup environment

To build with Symphony you'll need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP 5.3 or above
- PHP's LibXML module, with the XSLT extension enabled (--with-xsl)
- MySQL 5.0 or above
- An Apache webserver (can be used with others, but we'll focus on Apache server in this tutorial)
- Apache's mod_rewrite module

> For Windows, try [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), will have all you need in the default install.
