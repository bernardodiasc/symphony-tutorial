# 06. Mywebsite ensemble

The last extension we'll install in this tutorial is the [Export Ensemble](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/export_ensemble/), this is extension creates an installable version of your Symphony website.

I've installed this extension and exported the installation files for the __Mywebsite__ project. Check it here [https://github.com/x-team/symphony-tutorial/tree/gh-pages/mywebsite](https://github.com/x-team/symphony-tutorial/tree/gh-pages/mywebsite).

To install just put the files in your apache server public folder and open the URL in the browser, then you'll see the install wizard. After this is pretty much a well-known path from this tutorial.

Hope you have enjoyed.

Cheers.
